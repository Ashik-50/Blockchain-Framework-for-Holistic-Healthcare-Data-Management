# ECC-Blockchain Healthcare Framework

A secure healthcare data management system using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Secure ECC Encryption**: Patient data encrypted using Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- **Blockchain Immutability**: Medical records stored on an immutable blockchain
- **IPFS Storage**: Encrypted medical records stored off-chain in IPFS
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated access control and permission management
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface for patients, doctors, and administrators

## Architecture

The system implements the core algorithms from the research paper:

1. **EMR Creation and Secure Storage** (Algorithm 1)
2. **Permissioned EMR Retrieval** (Algorithm 2)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd healthcare_blockchain
2. **Install the requirements**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the command**
   ```bash
   python main.py
